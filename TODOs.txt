- The New Project system is a bit clunky, maybe we can make it more intuitive.
   - This is because the open file dialog opens a parent folder, then asks for another folder name. It should just be the folder you select.

- Create project didn't seem to actually open the project.

- Add a feature system, rather than the SHOW_MESSAGE / RUN_COMMAND / LLM_PROMPT hacks, we'll append to the prompt as needed and remove bloat.
   - Something to append to the prompt too - maybe a "next prompt" feature.

- "Milestone system" -- Constantly prompt the LLM to reach a milestone for the continuation prompting.
- The RUN_COMMAND feature should have a live-view of the output, as well as source correctly as the shell would.

- Add auto prompting option for LLM_PROMPTs. Maybe a 3-second timer? I.e. after the setLLMprompt, if this feature is active, it'll just automatically hit Submit after 3 seconds, unless cancelled.

- Move the Execute button to the left.
- Need to add Windows compatibility to the execute button.
- Add a new file icon.
- We should note when modifications are made in the file viewer, and prompt when changes were made that weren't saved prior to submit.
