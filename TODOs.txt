- The Recent Files menu does not update between projects.
- When switching projects, the enabled files clears for some reason, probably related to file watching?
- Add an open workspace button - opens in the default file explorer.
- Put the workspace path in the title bar.
- Add a feature system, rather than the SHOW_MESSAGE / RUN_COMMAND / LLM_PROMPT hacks, we'll append to the prompt as needed and remove bloat.
   - Something to append to the prompt too - maybe a "next prompt" feature.

- Move the Execute button to the left.
- Add a new file icon.
- The New Project system is a bit clunky, maybe we can make it more intuitive.

- The RUN_COMMAND feature should have a live-view of the output, as well as source correctly as the shell would.
- Need to add Windows compatibility to the execute button.
- We should note when modifications are made in the file viewer, and prompt when changes were made that weren't saved prior to submit.
- Add CTRL+ENTER to shortcut the submit button.
- Add auto prompting option for LLM_PROMPTs. Maybe a 3-second timer?
- Auto add new files created by the LLM.

- "Milestone system" -- Constantly prompt the LLM to reach a milestone for the continuation prompting.
