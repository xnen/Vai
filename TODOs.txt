== Bugs ==
Berzfad formatter seems to see plugin markers mid-line, should be @ start of trimmed line.

== Quality of Life ==
- Add "open file location" in the right click menu of files in the project panel.
   - Also remove "Use as workspace" if it's not a directory.

- The file viewer should limit the filesize to a certain number of characters, or maybe check if the formatter is the performance bottleneck.
- Instead of the default OpenJDK icon, we should create/use a Vai icon, if possible.

- The text area does not allow CTRL+Z to undo. In fact, many common text interactions are strange, like hitting End moves to
  the end of the current text line, rather than the end of the real line. Like there's no newlines, hitting End should go to the end.
  So maybe we use a separate text area type? We could try the formatted text area like we did with the file viewer formatted to Markdown.

- Ctrl+Clicking on a file should append it to the prompt, with single tick marks around it.

- The prompt text area should be resizable, atm it's fixed at the bottom of the window.
- Save the last model used.
- Include the current open file in file viewer in the title.
- Adding CTRL+Z for things like deleting things from active llm context would be nice.


== New ==
- We should have a history of all features that have been used, i.e. SHOW_MESSAGE, RUN_COMMAND, LLM_PROMPT, etc.
    - Clicking on the entry should show the full context of the feature, i.e. the contents of SHOW_MESSAGE, RUN_COMMAND, LLM_PROMPT, etc.
    - This should be easily accessible from the "Recent" menu.

- "Milestone system" -- Constantly prompt the LLM to reach a milestone for the continuation prompting.
   - Separate UI for milestones, auto prompting should always prompt "Continue development for milestone X" and then the next prompt

- Context groups - Allow for a set of files to be grouped together, and prompted together. User specifies group name given the current active files.

- It'd be nice to add a "Find" feature to the file viewer.
- Add Right Click > New Folder (or File) in the project panel.

- We should simplify the Berzfad format, rather than using the hacky title-based feature format.

- Possibly like "ctrl+click to add" within file reader. i.e. Ctrl+Click on a given class, it will look in recents, if one matches the name, it'll add it.
